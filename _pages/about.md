Greetings! I am Junzhou Chen, a first-year Ph.D. student at [William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/). My main research interests lie in Embodied AI, Autonomous Driving, and Embedded Robotics. I possess strong coding skills and have led the development of several successful projects, all of which achieved exceptional outcomes. My goal is to ensure that my research goes beyond academic publications to address real-world challenges and contribute meaningfully to social progress. I hope my research can truly solve practical problems, not just be confined to papers, and make a real contribution to social progress!
